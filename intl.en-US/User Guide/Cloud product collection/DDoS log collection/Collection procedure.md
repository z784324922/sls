# Collection procedure {#task_htt_wlz_32b .task}

In the Anti-DDoS Pro console, you can enable DDos log collection function for the website.

1.  Enable Anti-DDoS Pro function, purchase Anti-DDoS Pro instances, and [Online configuration](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/35216.html).
2.  Activate Log Service.

Log Service supports real-time collection of **Alibaba Cloud Anti-DDoS Pro** website access logs, CC attack logs, and supports real-time query and analysis of collected log data. The results of the query are displayed in the form of dashboards, and logs are used to analyze the access and attack behavior in real time, and assist the security department to formulate a protection strategy.

1.  Log on to the Anti-DDoS Pro console and select **Log** \> **Full Log** in the left-side navigation pane. Enter the Full Log page. 
2.  If you are configuring DDoS log collection for the first time, follow the instructions on the page.  DDoS has permission to distribute DDoS logs to your Logstore after authorization.
3.  Select the website for which you want to enable DDoS log collection function and make sure the **Status** is on. 

     ![](images/6786_en-US.jpg "Enable the function") 

    At this point, you have successfully enabled DDoS log collection for the current website. Log Service automatically creates a Logstore under your account. DDoS imports all the logs of the website that have this feature enabled into this Logstore. For Logstore default configurations, see [Default configuration](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Cloud product collection/DDoS log collection/Collection procedure.md#table_q3w_jrm_j2b).

    |Default configuration item|Configuration content|
    |:-------------------------|:--------------------|
    |Project|By default, `ddos-pro-logstore` project is created.|
    |Logstore|By default, Logstore is created. Logstore name is determined by the domain of the DDoS you purchased.    -   DDoS instances in mainland China: `ddos-pro-project-Alibaba Cloud Account ID-cn-hangzhou`.
    -   Other DDoS instances: `ddos-pro-project-Alibaba Cloud Account ID-ap-southeast-1`
All logs generated by the DDoS log collection function are saved in this Logstore.

|
    |Region|     -   If the DDoS region is in mainland China, the default project is saved in China East 1.
    -   If the DDoS region is outside mainland China, the default project is saved in Asia Pacific SE 1.
 |
    |Shard|By default, two shards are created and the [Auto split shard](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Preparation/Manage a Shard.md) feature is turned on.|
    |Log storage time|The default storage time is three days, within the free quota. After three days logs are automatically deleted.For longer storage time, you can customize the configurations. For more information, see the **How to modify the storage time of the website log** section in [Billing method](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Cloud product collection/DDoS log collection/Billing method.md).

|
    |Dashboard|By default, two dashboards are created:    -   `**ddos-pro-logstore\_**ddos_operation_center`: Operation center
    -   `**ddos-pro-logstore\_**ddos_access_center`: Access center
For more information about dashboards, see [Log Report](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Cloud product collection/DDoS log collection/Log Report.md).|

    You can query and analyze the collected logs in real time on the currentFull Log page. See the following figure for a log field description.  In addition, Log Service creates two DDoS Operation center and Access center dashboards. You can also customize the dashboard configurations.
