# Log Reports {#reference_emx_xkq_32b .reference}

The Log Reports page is integrated with the Dashboard page of Log Service. On this page, you can view default dashboards. You can filter business and security data about your website by modifying the time range or adding filters.

## View reports {#section_mvp_4qn_j2b .section}

1.  Log on to the [Web Application Firewall console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/waf), and choose **App Market** \> **App Management**.
2.  Click the Real-time Log Query and Analysis Service area to open the Log Service page.
3.  \[DO NOT TRANSLATE\]****
4.  Select a domain and check that the **Status** switch on the right is turned on.
5.  Click **Log Reports**.

    The page that appears is integrated with the Dashboard page of Log Service. A **filter** is automatically added to display all log entries that are recorded for the domain you selected. In this example, the filter is `matched_host: www.aliyun.com`.

After you enable the WAF log collection feature, Log Service creates three dashboards by default: the Operation Center, Access Center, and Security Center.

**Note:** For more information about the default dashboards, see [Default dashboards](#).

|Dashboard|Description|
|:--------|:----------|
|Operation Center|Displays operation details such as the proportion of valid requests and the statistics of attacks, traffic details such as the peak of both inbound and outbound throughput and the number of requests received, operation trends, attack overview, and other information.|
|Access Center|Displays basic access details such as the number of page views \(PV\) and the number of unique visitors \(UV\), the access trend, the distribution of visitors, and other information.|
|Security Center|Displays basic index information of attacks, attack types, attack trend, attacker distribution, and other information.|

![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/41421/154743384121419_en-US.png)

**Note:** Dashboards displays various reports using the layout that is predefined in WAF Log Service. The following table describes the graph types supported for reports. For more information about the graph types supported by Log Service, see [Graph description](../../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Query and visualization/Analysis graph/Graph description.md#).

|Type|Description|
|:---|:----------|
|Number|Graphs of this type display important metrics, such as the valid request ratio and the peak of attacks.|
|Line chart and area chart|Graphs of these types display the trend of important metrics within a specified time period, such as the trend of inbound throughput and the trend of attack interceptions.|
|Map|Graphs of this type display the geographical distribution of visitors and attackers, for example, by country. Heat maps are also supported to illustrate the distribution of attackers.|
|Pie chart|Graphs of this type display a distribution, such as the distribution of attackers and the distribution of client types.|
|Table|Graphs of this type display a table that contains information, such as information of attackers.|
|Map|Graphs of this type display the geographical distribution of data.|

## Time selector {#section_uf1_hwn_j2b .section}

The data in all graphs on the dashboard page are generated based on different time ranges. If you want to unify the time ranges, configure the **time selector**.

1.  On the **Log Reports** page, click **Please Select** and
2.  select a time range in the pane that appears. You can select a relative time, a time frame, or customize a time range.

**Note:** 

-   After you set a time range, the time range is applied to all reports.
-   If you set a time range, a temporary view is generated on the current page. When you view reports next time, the default time range is used.
-   To change the time range for a single report in the dashboard, click ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/41421/154743384121432_en-US.png) in the upper-right corner.

![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/41421/154743384121420_en-US.png)

## Data drilldown {#section_vlj_ttv_qfb .section}

The drilldown operation is enabled for some graphs on the dashboard page, which provides you a quick access to the detailed data.

![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/41421/154743384121475_en-US.png)

The drilldown operation is available for graphs marked with a ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/41421/154743384121474_en-US.png) icon in the upper-right corner. You can click a number with an underline to view the detailed underlying data. For example, to quickly find the domains that are attacked and the number of attacks, click the number in the **Attacked Hosts** graph of the **Security Center** report.

**Note:** Alternatively, switch to the **Raw Log** tab to find the relevant log entries.
