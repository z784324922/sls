# Python SDK {#reference_l5b_225_xdb .reference}

## Download address  {#section_gx3_35f_jdb .section}

SDK GitHub:

[https://github.com/aliyun/aliyun-log-python-sdk](https://github.com/aliyun/aliyun-log-python-sdk)

## Procedure {#section_ylg_r1r_12b .section}

Follow these steps to start using the Log Service Python SDK quickly.

## Step 1. Create an Alibaba Cloud account {#section_zlg_r1r_12b .section}

For more information, see [Sign up with Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/50482.htm).

## Step 2. Obtain an Alibaba Cloud AccessKey {#section_amg_r1r_12b .section}

Before using Log Service Python SDK, you must apply for an [AccessKey](../../../../../reseller.en-US/API Reference/AccessKey.md).

Log on to the Access Key Management page. Select an AccessKey for SDK.  If you do not have any, create one and make sure the AccessKey is **enabled**. For more information about how to create an access key, see [Preparation](../../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Preparation/Preparation.md).

The AccessKey is used in the following steps and must be kept confidential. For more information about [Configurations](reseller.en-US/SDK Reference/Basic Descriptions /Configurations.md) how to use the AccessKey in SDK.

## Step 3 Create a Log Service project and a Logstore {#section_zrq_dbr_12b .section}

Before using Log Service PHP SDK, you must create a Log Service project and a Logstore in the console.

Before using Log Service Python SDK, you must create a Log Service project and a Logstore in the console.

1.  Log on to the Log Service console.
2.  Click Create Project in the upper-right corner.Click **Create Project** in the upper right corner.
3.  Enter the **Project Name** and select the **Region**. Click **Confirm**.
4.  On the Project List page, click the name of the project, and then click **Create**.  [Create a Logstore](../../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Preparation/Manage a Logstore.md#).

    After you create a project, you can also click **Create** to create a Logstore based on the system prompt.

5.  Complete the configurations, and click **Confirm**.

    Enter the Logstore Name and Data Retention Time.  Select the Number of [Shards](../../../../../reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Basic concepts/Shard.md#) as needed. In this example, you must configure four shards.


**Note:** 

-   Make sure that you use the same Alibaba Cloud account to obtain the Alibaba Cloud AccessKey and create the Log Service project and Logstore.
-   For more information about the concepts of Log Service such as project and Logstore, see [Basic concepts](../../../../../reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Basic concepts.md).
-   A project name must be globally unique in Log Service, and a Logstore name must be unique in the same project.
-   After a project is created, you cannot modify the region  or migrate the project across regions.

## Step 4. Install a Python environment {#section_a1t_j2j_sy .section}

The Python SDK is a pure Python library and supports all Python operating systems, including Linux, Mac OS  X and Windows. Please install Python as follows:

1.  Download and install the latest Python [installation package](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

    **Note:** 

    -   Currently, Python SDK supports the Python 2.6/2.7 and Python  3.3/3.4/3.5/3.6 environments.  You can run the`python  -V`command to query the current version of Python.
    -   Python does not officially support Python 2.6 and Python 3.3. We recommend that you use Python 2.7, Python  3.4, and later versions.
2.  Download and install the Python package management tool  [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html).

    After pip is installed, run`pip  -V` to check whether the installation is successful and query the current pip version. 


## Step 5. Install a Python SDK {#section_bqt_42j_sy .section}

Run the following command as an administrator in Shell to install Python SDK.

```
pip install -U aliyun-log-python-sdk
```

## Step 6. Start a Python program {#section_kbx_x2j_sy .section}

You can start using the Python SDK. To interact with Log Service and obtain the relevant output, run the following sample code in a text editor or Python IDE.
